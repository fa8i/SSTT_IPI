# Industrial Production Index (IPI) Time Series Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook analyzing the time series evolution of the Industrial Production Index (IPI) in Spain. 
The notebook includes multiple linear regressions with and without intercept, as well as SARMAX models with and without trend.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis consists of historical data on the Industrial Production Index (IPI) of Spain. 

## Libraries Used
The analysis was performed using the following Python libraries:
- NumPy (import numpy as np)
- Pandas (import pandas as pd)
- Seaborn (import seaborn as sns)
- Matplotlib (import matplotlib.pyplot as plt)
- Scikit-learn (from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error)
- Statsmodels (from statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax import SARIMAX)

## Usage
To run the notebook, make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed along with the required Python libraries listed above. Simply open the notebook file (`analysis.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells.

## Note
Please note that the results presented in the notebook are for demonstration purposes only and may not reflect the most accurate analysis of the Industrial Production Index (IPI) in Spain.
